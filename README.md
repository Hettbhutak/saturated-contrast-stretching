Iâ€™ve been working on an image processing tool using libraries like Matplotlib, Pandas, and CSV, where I implemented Saturated-Contrast-Stretching to enhance image contrast.
This technique stretches pixel values to the full range (0-255), improving visibility by:

Identifying the minimum and maximum pixel values.
Setting pixels below/above the thresholds to 0 and 255, respectively.
Linearly mapping pixels in between to maximize contrast.
It's fascinating how a few lines of code can transform images!
